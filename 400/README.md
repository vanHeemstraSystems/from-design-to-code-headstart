Following this tutorial "Getting started with Anima - How to turn design into code" at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQaPYzSQqpo&list=PLvftPKgDrSwbjUppYOQqVflEmPYHFf6kV

## 100 - Open your workspace at Anima

Browse to https://projects.animaapp.com/team/not-applicable-3byvvd3/

Click "Sample Project".

If you click on a design it will take you to an omniview at https://projects.animaapp.com/team/not-applicable-3byvvd3/project/NjJXCwW/screen/desktop1280dashboard/omniview?mode=play

Along the top you have three options:

- Play: play the view
- Comment: leave a comment
- Code: view the code

## 200 - View code

Choose "Code" from the options along the top of the omniview at https://projects.animaapp.com/team/not-applicable-3byvvd3/project/NjJXCwW/screen/desktop1280dashboard/omniview?mode=play

When you click with your mouse pointer on one of the elements on the view, it opens up two panels beneath; one for HTML and the other for CSS.

You can also use the drop-down menu "HTML" to switch to "React" or "Vue".


## 300 - Upload your own design to Anima
