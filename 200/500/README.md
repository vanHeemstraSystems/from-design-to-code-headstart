# 500 - Accessibility starts early in the process

This one is huge for me. By really understanding the ideas contained in the design, you will have an easier time picking semantic HTML elements and finding appropriate accessible patterns to build out what you see there. Accessibility can work its way into the daily work you do, rather than an afterthought or extra burden. Our perspective becomes that ***high-quality front-end code correctly expresses the nature and structure of its content to all users***, and accessibility is how we measure that.

After a pretty short period, you’ll see how often designs conform to one known pattern or another, and the flow of breaking something down into known patterns to implement will speed up dramatically. [Carie Fisher nicely sums up ideas related to this “Accessibility-first” approach](https://www.24a11y.com/2017/accessibility-first/).
