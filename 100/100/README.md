# Pass 1: Layout-level ideas

![example_web_site_design_pass_001](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12828104/136924964-73815d8a-a005-40dd-89be-5894d682b117.png)

In this design we have a few layout ideas that stand out right off the bat.

- A header with a horizontal nav section
- A main content column within the content area—left and right edges align within all sections from header to footer
- Sections with two columns
- Sections with a single centered column
- Sections with a single left-aligned column
- A footer with three columns
- Fairly generous padding inside each section

***First impressions***
We should note any other first impressions we have during this first pass, good or bad. We can never have a first impression twice, and some of our gut reactions and questions can be forgotten if we neglect noting them now. Plus, identifying specific stuff that you like in the design can be nice when we get to talking with the designer. It both helps to celebrate the good stuff and mix it in with other constructive criticism.

Our first impressions might be things like:

- 👍 The design is clean-looking and readable.
- 👍 The sections are all titled by questions (good, helps draw reader in and gives each section a clear purpose).
- 🤨 Question marks are used inconsistently in the titles (possibly just an oversight?).
- 🙋‍♀️ Sometimes there are very similar font sizes right next to each other (may need to follow up to see if this is intentional because it seems a less slick and professional than the rest of the site).
- 👍 The logo is nice with that little gradient going on.
