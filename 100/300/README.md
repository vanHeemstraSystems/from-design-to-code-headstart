# Pass 3: Color palette

![example_web_site_design_pass_003](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12828104/136926799-b92b6948-e555-4963-a0bf-2ebc5ebf3be7.png)

There is not too much going on in this design color-wise.

- blue/purple primary color
- light/dark body text colors
- light/dark link colors
- nice gradient under the word “hope” in the logo
- light gray background color
- dark navy background color
- specific red and green “checkmark” and “stop” icon colors

Some design tools let you export the color hex values used in the design file, or even full-on Sass or CSS variable declarations. If you have that option, use it. Otherwise, find your own way to grab those values and name them because those are the foundation for lots of our initial CSS work.

Throughout our CSS and other code, we want to be refer to colors with labels or classes like “primary” and “secondary” that we can reuse throughout the code. This makes it easier to adjust values in the future, and to add themes down the line if we ever need to.
