# Pass 2: Element-level ideas

![example_web_site_design_pass_002](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12828104/136926122-3effbae6-c948-439b-82dc-8f7d30108fe6.png)

Here are things we might notice in this second pass:

- Primary (blue) and Secondary (white) button styles, plus a “Learn more” button in the header with a little arrow (an expanding menu maybe?)
- Heading and sub-heading styles
- Three “body text” sizes (16px, 18px, 20px)
- A “dark-mode” section where text color is white and the background is dark
- A consistent presentation of “image & caption” sets
- Custom bullet points of various kinds
- Inline links in the text are underlined and, other links, like those in the footer, are not.
- A repeated card component with an icon on top, and a heading and a list inside the card
- The logo repeats a few times in different contexts/sizes.
- The footer contains uppercase headings that don’t appear elsewhere.
